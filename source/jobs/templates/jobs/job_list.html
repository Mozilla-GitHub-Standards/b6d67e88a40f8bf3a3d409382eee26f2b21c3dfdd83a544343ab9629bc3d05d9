    <h3>About Source Jobs Listings</h3>
    <p>To list open jobs, you&rsquo;ll need an organization profile the listings can be associated with. Here's how to get started.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>If you already have a contact person registered to update your Source organizational profile, that person can log in and add job listings immediately.</li>
        <li>If you have a <a href="{{ url('organization_list') }}">Source organization profile</a>, but don't have a contact person registered, have your news apps editor (or nearest person to that role) <a href="mailto:source@mozillafoundation.org?subject=Registration for Job Listings">contact us</a> to register and start listing jobs.</li>
        <li>If you don't have an organizational profile but you want to list news tech jobs, <a href="mailto:source@mozillafoundation.org?subject=Job Listings">contact us</a> to request a listing.</li>
    </ul>
